My "Hello World" for OpenGL: A triangle that you can apply torque to with your mouse-wheel. Trackpads not yet supported.
- Scrolling up increases angular velocity.
- Scrolling down decreases angular velocity.
The more vigorously you scroll, the faster your triangle will angularly accelerate/decelerate.
